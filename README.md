# GifTastic

So for this web app, I wanted to use Bootstrap to create a response website where you can dynamically add buttons which will populate 10 fixed height gifs for whatever is written on the button. You can also pause and play the gifs (technically it's not a pause, it just restarts the gif when you unpause it)

The theme I chose is football teams, though technically you can add whatever button you want
